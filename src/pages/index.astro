          I am developing a full-fledged hospital website with a management
          system capable of handling appointments, exams results, billing and
          all sorts of features. To do it, I am relying on <span

          > to do the styling and keep a clean and consistent user interface, <span

          Since we now have this whole AI thing with dozens of diferent --- and
          wonderful --- ideas, I decided to get on to mine own with a project to
          help those who have simple questions about their pets. The ideia is to
          provide some basic info from ChatGPT in a form, nothing crazy or
          anything. I intend to start it as soon as I have some free time to do
          so

          During the COVID-19 pandemic I was enrolled in college studying
          History. I had a grasp of IT back then, because of it ----- and to

          >, a website to gather and publish verified content about Latin
          America's history. I was responsible for managing everyone and
          handling the UI/UX design and backend. Everything was built on top of
