          Since we now have this whole AI thing with dozens of diferent --- and
          wonderful --- ideas, I decided to get on to mine own with a project to
          help those who have simple questions about their pets. The ideia is to
          provide some basic info from ChatGPT in a form, nothing crazy or
          anything. I intend to start it as soon as I have some free time to do
          so

          As my wife is a teacher, she gave me the idea to build something that
          would help impoverished children to learn how to read and write in
          Portuguese and English. I'm not really sure about what to do or how to
          do it, but I would put my money on some silly educative games, so I
          guess <span class="text-default-900">Three.js</span> is the way to go

          >, a website to gather and publish verified content about Latin
          America's history. I was responsible for managing everyone and
          handling the UI/UX design and backend. Everything was built on top of

          So I did an odd job to a friend of mine that started a book publishing
          company called <span class="text-default-900">Editora La Vita</span>.
          I didn't have all the knowledge or time I have now, so I talked to her
          and suggested to redo her website that was, again, built on top of <span
            class="text-default-900">Elementor</span
          >. I intend to implement Google Sign-in and some modern technologies to get her going on a safe, sound and pretty website to sell her books
